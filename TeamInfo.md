## Project Summary
When we use the rating applications, we can only see the rates of restaurants and the general review of the whole restaurant. Even though there are photos and customer reviews of the dishes offered by the restaurants, it is hard for users to find whether the cuisine is good or not in the restaurant. The user has to read through the reviews and match the review with photos to determine the quality of the dish by themselves. So, we want to develop a new application that can display the ingredients, price, and rate of several selected dishes. Customers can compare the same dish from different restaurants to make a better choice of restaurants.
